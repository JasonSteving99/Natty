# Sound
This is a component that handles generating short game tones that can be used to add some style
and life to otherwise bland experiences. This will just be running in a terminal as part of a game
loop, so it should be performant and very simple to interact with.

## Responsibilities

Produce sound on speakers.
Sounds should be interesting, short game tones for things like collisions.
Retro style sounds harkening back to N64 style games.
For now only supports two sounds, a ball "bouncing" tone, and an explosion.
