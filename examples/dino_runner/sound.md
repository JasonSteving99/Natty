# Game Sound System

This component handles all sound effects and audio for the dinosaur runner game, providing retro 8-bit style audio feedback.

## Characteristics
- 8-bit style sound effects reminiscent of early computer/console games
- Simple but effective audio cues for game events
- Low complexity synthesized sounds

## Functionality
The sound system should:
1. Play jump sound when the dinosaur jumps
2. Play collision sound when the dinosaur hits an obstacle
3. Play score milestone sounds at certain point thresholds
4. Play a game over sound when the game ends
5. Potentially provide a simple background music loop
6. Manage sound resources efficiently
7. Allow for muting/volume control

## Sound Effects
- **Jump Sound**: A short, upward-pitched blip sound
- **Point Sound**: Brief celebratory sound for score milestones (every 100 points)
- **Collision Sound**: Distinctive crash/explosion sound for game over
- **Background Music**: Optional simple loop that speeds up as score increases
- **Button/UI Sounds**: Minimal feedback for menu navigation

## Technical Implementation
- Synthesize sounds programmatically for true 8-bit feel
- Keep audio files small and optimized
- Support audio playback on various platforms
- Ensure sounds play with minimal latency for responsive feedback
- Handle multiple simultaneous sounds appropriately

## Sound Design Philosophy
The audio should enhance gameplay by:
- Providing clear feedback for player actions
- Creating a sense of progression and achievement
- Adding to the retro aesthetic without being distracting
- Maintaining consistency with the visual style
- Creating a nostalgic but fresh audio experience
