# Input Handler

This component manages all user input for the dinosaur runner game.

## Responsibilities
The input handler is responsible for:
1. Detecting and processing keyboard inputs
2. Mapping input events to game actions
3. Providing a clean interface for other systems to query input state
4. Handling input based on current game state

## Functionality
The input handler should:
1. Detect key presses for jumping (spacebar)
2. Detect key presses for game control (pause, restart)
3. Provide debouncing for inputs where needed
4. Buffer inputs appropriately for responsive controls
5. Filter inputs based on current game state
6. Support keyboard events with appropriate event handling
7. Provide methods for other systems to query if actions should occur

## Input Mapping
- **Spacebar**: Trigger dinosaur jump (when on ground)
- **P key**: Pause/unpause game
- **R key**: Restart game (when in game over state)
- **Enter/Return**: Start game from title screen or restart after game over

## Technical Requirements
- Low latency input processing
- Clean separation from game logic
- Support for simultaneous key presses
- Input state querying for other systems

## Interface
The input handler provides:
- Events or signals when specific actions are triggered
- Methods to query the current state of inputs
- Configuration options for key bindings
- Contextual input handling based on game state
