# Game World

This component manages the overall game world state and environment for the dinosaur runner game.

## Responsibilities
The game world is responsible for:
1. Managing the game environment and background elements
2. Coordinating obstacle generation and placement
3. Handling world scrolling and parallax effects
4. Maintaining the ground/platform state
5. Managing difficulty progression as the game advances

## Functionality
The game world should:
1. Generate the scrolling ground/platform that the dinosaur runs on
2. Create obstacles at appropriate intervals based on difficulty
3. Control the scrolling speed of the game (increasing over time)
4. Manage background elements with parallax scrolling
5. Implement day/night cycle transitions based on score
6. Handle world state reset when restarting the game
7. Provide information about the current world state to other systems
8. Coordinate environmental effects and visual elements

## World Elements
- **Ground/Platform**: The surface the dinosaur runs on
- **Obstacles**: Various objects the dinosaur must avoid
- **Background**: Distant elements (mountains, clouds) with parallax scrolling
- **Environmental Effects**: Visual elements that enhance the game world

## Difficulty Progression
- Increase scrolling speed gradually as the game progresses
- Decrease time between obstacle spawns at higher scores
- Introduce more complex obstacle patterns at score thresholds
- Adjust parameters to ensure the game remains challenging but fair

## Technical Requirements
- Efficient memory management for created/destroyed obstacles
- Seamless infinite scrolling ground implementation
- Procedural obstacle generation with appropriate patterns
- Clean interface for other systems to query world state

## Interface
The game world provides:
- Access to current obstacle positions and types
- Current scroll speed and difficulty parameters
- Methods to reset the world state
- World update function for the game loop
